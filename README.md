Notes:

- Re-added tips and length checkboxes so user can choose which ones to display when "Display Tips" is pressed

- Added option to switch between black BG and image BG when doing Tips Animation

- Added "Revert All Changes" button for undoing all changes in threshold or display mode

- Added "Reset" in Menu Bar --> Action for resetting/deleting all manually detected tips

- Changed the tips color option to a color dialog box

- Fixed bug when selecting reference point - if user selects reference point midway, the tips that have been saved prior
to changing the reference point will be cleared (to keep all numerical data consistent under one reference point)
